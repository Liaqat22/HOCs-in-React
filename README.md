# About Higher Order Components (HOC)
HOC are the way to reuse the component logic.
It takes a componet as input and returns a new component with additional apllied operation on it.

# Example
in the example we created 3 componet .
CompontA .
CompontB .
HOC : in this we have created one single logic that we have used in both ComponentA and ComponentB without created same logic separately for each componet.
